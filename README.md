## SJA Volunteering Documents

I made a spreadsheet and thought I would share in case anyone else wants to use it too :)

### Shift Booking Spreadsheet

Available [here](https://github.com/natstar93/SJAVolunteering/raw/master/Volunteering_Shifts_template.xlsx).

A spreadsheet to keep track of shifts you have volunteered for. It is not always easy/possible to find these in the GRS app after you have expressed interest.

- Contains some basic dropdown lists for Location and Role. 
- Includes a 'No of volunteers' field so you can see how likely you are to get into a particular shift. Please fill this in as soon as you have opted in to a particular role. Advice from welcome email: *Each spot in GRS is for one volunteer, and you may see 10+ people applying for each spot at the Excel - you will usually only be able to get shifts where you are the first person applying (0 others volunteered at the moment you booked) or close to that when people have to cancel.*


Don't want to use the spreadsheet? I would recommend at least taking a screenshot of your booking in the app so you have a record of it.
